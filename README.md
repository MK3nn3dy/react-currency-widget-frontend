# Exchange Rates React Widget

## Frontend

This is a simple exchange rates widget I made as a tech test for a job interview. It was made within the day. It uses:

- React
- Redux
- Node / Express
- <a hred="https://exchangeratesapi.io/">exchangeratesapi.io</a>

Feel free to use the code in your own application.

*Note that this must be used in conjunction with the <a href="https://github.com/MK3nn3dy/react-currency-widget-backend">backend</a> unless you modify it, as there were bonus points for running all requests through a backend and keeping API keys there.*
